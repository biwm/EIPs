By allowing for a decentralized URI to point to a JSON object of many NFT IDs we can solve this issue by providing metadata for many tokens at one time rather than one at a time.

Decentralized storage means permanence - in the fast-moving world of digital marketing campaigns, or art projects mistakes can happen. As such, it is important for creators to have flexibility when creating their projects. Therefore, this standard allows creators to opt in at a time of their choosing.
